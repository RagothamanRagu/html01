    Life is the aspect of existence that processes, acts, reacts, evaluates, and evolves through growth (reproduction
    and metabolism). The crucial difference between life and non-life (or non-living things) is that life uses energy
    for physical and conscious development. Life is anything that grows and eventually dies, i.e., ceases to proliferate
    and be cognizant. Can we say that viruses, for example, are cognizant? Yes, insofar as they react to stimuli; but
    they are alive essentially because they reproduce and grow. Computers are non-living because even though they can
    cognize, they do not develop biologically (grow), and cannot produce offspring. It is not cognition that determines
    life, then: it is rather proliferation and maturation towards a state of death; and death occurs only to living
    substance
